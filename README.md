I made  a Random-User-Page-Generator.
 What exactly is a Random-User-Page-Generator (or RUPG for short, pronounced ruh-pa-geh)? Itâ€™s essentially a Facebook profile page, filled with content taken from APIs and generated with different data at the click of a button.
 by using APIs, jQuery, Handlebars, Promises and of course creating it all in OOP. Are you Excited? clone and see the beauty :):):)
